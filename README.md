This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  Improper handling of observers can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior. The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected version with proper observer removal to avoid dangling pointers and retain cycles.  This example highlights the importance of meticulous memory management in Objective-C when working with KVO.
