The solution involves ensuring that the observer is always removed before the observed object is deallocated. This can be done by removing the observer in the `dealloc` method of the observer or in any method that releases the observed object.  It is best practice to remove the observer as soon as it is no longer needed. 

```objectivec
@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyObservedObject *observedObject;
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... handle changes ...
}

-(void) dealloc {
    [self.observedObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

@interface MyObservedObject : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObservedObject
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyObservedObject deallocated");
}
@end

// ... later in some code ...
MyObservedObject *observed = [[MyObservedObject alloc] init];
MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
observer.observedObject = observed;
[observed addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
// ... some operations ...
[observed removeObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty"]; //Good practice, but dealloc in observer handles this
[observed release];
[observer release];
```
By removing the observer in the `dealloc` method, we guarantee that it will always be removed before the observed object is deallocated, even if the observed object is deallocated unexpectedly.
